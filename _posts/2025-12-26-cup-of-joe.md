I love coffee, and I have for the majority of my life. I’ve also been to a _lot_ of cafes in my time, and they’re one of the things I have enough specific opinions about to feel like it’s fun to share them. This post started as a roundup of cafes I found this year, but I wanted to include more and more, so it turned into a more general list. These aren’t necessarily all of the best I’ve ever been to, just the ones that stick out in my mind.

# Boston
## Gracenote

![Interior of a cozy, modern coffee shop. A wooden counter runs across the foreground, topped with coffee equipment like metal kettles, a point-of-sale tablet, cups, and small display items. Behind the counter, two baristas are working: one appears to be operating an espresso machine while the other stands nearby, watching or assisting.
The background features white brick walls, open wooden shelves lined with neatly arranged bags of coffee beans, cups, and brewing tools. A chalkboard-style menu hangs high on the wall, and speakers are mounted near the shelves. Natural light comes in through a window, and there are a few green plants adding warmth to the space. Overall, the scene feels busy but inviting, with an artisanal café atmosphere.](assets/cafes/gracenote.jpg)
_This looks vageuly like a stock image but I assure you it's real[^c8]_

Gracenote was my go-to place for trips into Boston during high school and college, either to their location outside the Chinatown gate or on High Street. I get the sense they make most of their money from roasting/distributing beans (a few of the other places on this list use them), but their shops are great examples of third wave cafes, and serve a reliable latte. My absolute favorite is their cardamom coffee. Stop by if you’re passing through North Station.

## Cuppacoffee

![Interior of a small, well-lit coffee shop. The space has warm brown walls and a clean, organized layout. On the left, there’s a long counter with espresso machines, grinders, syrup bottles, and a glass display case filled with pastries. Above and behind the counter are shelves stocked with coffee supplies, cups, and jars, along with a chalkboard-style menu listing drinks.
Industrial-style pendant lights hang from the ceiling, adding to a modern café feel. On the right side, a narrow counter runs along the window with several round metal stools for seating, letting customers sit and look outside. Near the back, there’s a glass door with an exit sign above it and a small “order here” sign on the wall. Overall, the café feels cozy, efficient, and designed for quick service with a welcoming atmosphere.](assets/cafes/cuppa.webp)
_It’s smaller on the inside[^c9]_

I really enjoy savory pies, but they’re a pretty niche item in the US. KO pies in East Boston was a fantastic spot for them, but I was only able to go once before they had to shut down. So, when I was looking around North Station for a coffee before getting on a train to Newburyport, I was very happy to see an Australian coffee shop that serves pies as well. For those who aren’t aware, Australia has a first class espresso culture; high quality coffee is available everywhere, even outback outposts where all the water has to be trucked in. Cuppa lives up to this heritage, my flat white (invented in Australia or possibly New Zealand) and breakfast pie both being lovely. I probably won’t go back a ton since I’m not often in the area in the morning, but it’s a fun place that’s outside the usual cafe routine.

# Just Outside of Boston 

## Nine Bar Espresso

![A YouTube video thumbnail related to a coffee review. It shows the exterior of a café with a large sign that reads “Nine Bar Espresso” mounted on a blue building. In the foreground, a young man wearing a brown jacket is holding a cup of coffee and looking toward the camera with a thoughtful or uncertain expression. Red text near him says “HMMMM”, emphasizing a moment of evaluation or judgment.
At the top, there’s a YouTube interface bar indicating the video title “American Coffee Trip” with a runtime of 5:37, and a bold label reading “EPISODE 260.” At the bottom, the video description mentions “Single Sip Review, New England Coffee, Nine Bar Espresso (Somerville, MA)” along with hashtags.](assets/cafes/nine.png){: w="550"}
_This came up on google images for the cafe and it made me laugh so much. Hmmmm indeed.[^c10]_

After moving jobs from Billerica to a company based in Cambridge, I started staying with my girlfriends more on weekdays. Not only do I appreciate this due to “loving them” or whatever, but it also means that Nine Bar is now on my way to work. I love how I don’t even have to go in, as all orders are placed through a window on the sidewalk. Their lattes are a great, but my favorite item are actually the bagels. Usually I steer clear of getting food at places that don’t have a full kitchen (I’ve been burned by sad pastry cases too many times), but the bagels are fantastic. Warm, really high quality cream cheese, exactly what I want for breakfast. Check it out next time you’re in Davis Square.

## Boston King Coffee

![A barista with long brown hair in a “Boston King” baseball cap is operating an espresso machine. She’s wearing a green bead necklace and a white tanktop. The photo is at an angle, and there are menu boards and a counter behind her. The photo is at an angle for some reason, and the bottom has text that reads "KATIE MCMAHON/Staff photo"](assets/cafes/boston.png)
_This is from a newspaper article from when it opened in 2008, as you can tell by the 2008 of it all. Also, seems really early for bubble tea[^c11]_

The first time I went to this coffee shop, I was stopping by before touring an apartment that I now live in[^c1], and I’d be lying if I said it didn’t influence my decision to sign my lease since this cafe reminds me of my childhood. Boston King is a marvelous second wave cafe serving coffee drinks in a warm and welcoming environment. I get the sense a lot of families are regulars, and it reminds me of places my mom would take me during errands in early 00s California. The coffee is also fantastic, despite it being served in cups with an ad for a local car dealer printed on it. I don’t adore the food, but they sell tea and goods from Stonewall Kitchen, which came in handy when a porch pirate stole my office yankee swap gift the night before, and I had to improvise a last minute replacement the next morning.
 
## Java’s Brewin

![Exterior storefront of Java's Brewin' coffee shop on a clear day with bright blue sky. The business sign features a tan background with burgundy lettering, displaying the name 'Java's Brewin'' alongside a steaming coffee cup icon on the left and a cupcake icon on the right, all of which has an extremely 90s aesthetic. Red brick columns frame the storefront, and an American flag is visible in the window. A 'Help Wanted' sign is posted near the entrance."](assets/cafes/java.jpg)
_Look at this logo! Look at it!_

The only option for lunch at my aforementioned job in Billerica if I forgot to bring one was a restaurant run by the landlords of the office park. It was a step below “high school football game concessions” in terms of quality, and I stopped going when I saw a customers dog walking in and out of the kitchen. This is why I was especially happy to discover Java’s Brewin nearby. This shop gives big 90s vibes: they may serve espresso, but they have to have an explanation of what it is on the menu, and I think I’ve seen someone order a latte only once. What people do order is large cups of delicious drip coffee, muffins in like 15 flavors, and phenomenal breakfast sandwiches. I refer to it as “Republican Coffee” due to all of the American flags and country music[^c2] but everyone seems chill enough that it didn’t deter me. I recommend the hazelnut coffee, cranberry/blueberry muffins, and a bacon egg & cheese on focaccia with mayo/mustard
 
## Cafe Reynard

![A person wearing an orange fox mask with pointed features stands at the counter of a coffee shop, leaning against two black bar stools. They're dressed in a black coat with red text embroidery, a red bandana and collar around their neck, and a shirt with the IWW logo. Behind them is a modern coffee shop interior with light wood paneling and a large black shelving unit displaying rows of white mugs and cups. A barista in a black and white striped shirt and fox ears stands in the background near the coffee bar, which features red paneling and various coffee-making equipment."](assets/cafes/reynard.webp)
_Honestly this newspaper photo says all you need to know[^c12]_

I can say with complete honesty that this is the only cafe I’ve ever found from a poster in a sex shop. Cafe Reynard is a coffee shop and roaster that shares a storefront with Idle Hands Brewery in Malden: I found about it by seeing an ad with the above barista posted to the wall in Hubba Hubba (RIP). The coffee here is on another level, it’s the only place I only drink coffee black since I find their brews taste better that way. Their roaster is usually working the counter and is happy to chat, I even bought a bag of beans early one Sunday and it was still warm. The crowd is also amazing here, chances are high you’ll see someone with a tail or ears. The donuts also do not fall victim to Sad Pastry Case syndrome, and are fucking amazing. Beware that due to their space sharing arrangement, the hours are a little funky.

## The Cafe at Short Path Distillery

![Two people stand at a polished wooden bar in a craft brewery or distillery, each drinking from glass mugs. The person on the left wears a blue quilted vest over a black long-sleeve shirt and has short styled hair. The person on the right wears glasses and a blue, black, and white plaid flannel shirt. Behind them is an impressive display of numerous bottles arranged on wooden shelves against a white tiled wall with floral accents and exposed brick. A wooden mantel shelf sits above the brick section, and hanging plants are visible at the top of the frame."](assets/cafes/short.jpg)
_This post is quickly becoming a collection of staged photos for local papers, and honestly I’m here for it[^c13]_

What this cafe lacks in name and location, it makes up for in coffee. It has a similar setup to Reynard in that they share space with a tasting room, but the two co-operate at the same time, unlike Reynard which closes before the brewery opens. I feel like house-made syrups are the new trend/differentiation in coffee, and Short Path delivers, with a rosemary-juniper latte that was not too sweet and delightfully earthy. My girlfriend and I went here after a Costco run which I feel is definitely the move. Everyone was super friendly, and we were able to pick up some bottles of liquor too. The space is also such a vibe, with all the old mill transmission equipment still up in the ceiling.

# Maine

## Backyard

![Exterior view of Backyard Coffeehouse & Eatery, a coffee shop with dark gray vertical siding and cream-colored trim. The business name is displayed in white lettering above the entrance, which features French doors painted in cream. Industrial-style wall sconces flank the doorway, and a wooden barrel planter with bright pink flowers sits near the entrance. To the right of the building is an outdoor seating area with colorful plastic Adirondack chairs in blue, gray, and additional blue shades, arranged around wooden planters filled with flowers. A rainbow pride flag is prominently displayed in the seating area. The scene is set against a backdrop of a red brick building and mature trees under an overcast sky, with a paved parking area visible in the foreground"](assets/cafes/backyard.jpg)[^c14]

Every Saturday morning during the summer and shoulder season, my family would drive to Ogunquit, buy coffee and sandwiches at Backyard, then walk a mile or two along the beach. The coffee and food are good, but honestly nothing to write home about given the price. However, the location is phenomenal, and they have never let us down in the years we’ve been going, even when absolutely slammed with tourists. They also employed many of my classmates who came back for multiple seasons, which I think it a pretty good endorsement of how they treat their employees. 

## Breakaway Coffee, née Flight

![A YouTube video thumbnail from the channel "American Coffee Trip" titled "Single Sip Review, Flight Coffee (Dover, NH)." The image shows the exterior storefront of Flight Coffee Co. with large windows and outdoor seating. A young man wearing sunglasses stands in the foreground pointing toward the cafe, with large text overlays reading "EPISODE 172" and "HIDDEN GEM!"](assets/cafes/flight.png){: w="550"}
_Oh hey, it’s this guy again![^c3]_

This was my number one hangout spot in high school, and when I was sent home from college during COVID, I would get takeout from there nearly every day. Flight has always had a very strong aesthetic, and their espresso is delicious with a unique taste that I’ve never had anywhere else (except when I brew with their beans at home). The seating is comfy, the food is unique but not too weird, it’s just a great cafe to be able to have in your town, even if it gets immensely busy nearly all the time these days. I did hear that the owners were uh, intense about things like staffing, but it was bought by the head chef a few years ago who changed the name, so hopefully things have improved. I also think the opening of Flight Coffee in Dover marked the beginning of its transition from _Dirty Dover_ into _Portsmouth 2_, but you didn’t come here for my thoughts on Seacoast real estate. 

## Lil’s Cafe

![A close-up shot of a wire cooling rack filled with fresh French crullers. Golden-brown, sugar-dusted crullers sit in the foreground, clearly showing their twisted, ridged texture, while crullers topped with white glaze are visible in the background.](assets/cafes/lils.jpg)
_mmmmm cruller[^c4]_

These are the best crullers I’ve ever had. Sure, Lil’s has other stuff like lattes and breakfast stuff but come on. You want the crullers. Soft, sweet, imagine me as Homer Simpson thinking about a donut right now. Their Almond Croissants take honorable mention for their prodigious use of marzipan, which is a win in my book. The crowd here on weekdays is an amusing mix of families with small children, and Shipyard employees stopping by before their shifts. Kittery's only entry, which I’ve always been surprised how little coffee there is over there.

# New York City

## La Cabra

![Modern coffee shop interior with a long wooden counter; three masked baristas prepare drinks behind espresso machines on the left, while another masked staff member stands behind a glass pastry case on the right displaying donuts and pastries. Exposed ductwork, linear ceiling lights, and a large abstract wall artwork frame the scene. The whole thing is very Scandinavian modernist](assets/cafes/cabra.webp)
_"Putting handles would disturb the balance of the property." is a real quote from the Danish designer of their cups[^c5]_

This place rules mainly because it looks exactly like what someone from rural Maine thinks a stuck up Manhattan coffee shop looks like. All the employees wear button up shirts, the espresso machines are built into the light wood counters, and they call the drink “espresso with milk” rather than a latte (how gauche). The coffee is great but probably not all that different from anywhere else. The pastries are super creative and look visually very cool, although their actual flavor is a little hit or miss. It would always feel like an occasion when I made it downtown during school.

## SEY Coffee

![Modern coffee shop interior with a long wooden counter; three masked baristas prepare drinks behind espresso machines on the left, while another masked staff member stands behind a glass pastry case on the right displaying donuts and pastries. Exposed ductwork, linear ceiling lights, and a large abstract wall artwork frame the scene. The whole thing is very Scandinavian modernist](assets/cafes/sey.jpeg)
_\*Takes drag off cigarette\* Kid, this is the closest to Frutiger Aero you're going to get[^c6]_

While La Cabra only looks like an intimidating coffee shop, SEY actually _is_ an intimidating coffee shop. I only went once, but the interior really strikes an impression with all of the plant life in a very industrial area. This cafe has been rated the best in the USA by a few people, and while I don’t claim to have that level of taste, it did feel special going there. SEY is mainly a roaster, and you can really tell that they’re serious about bean selection and giving real info about them instead of vague tasting notes. They’re also gratuity free which I am always a fan of. Check it out if you want to go full coffee nerd.

## Super Nice Coffee and Bakery

![Exterior of a small café with a black awning reading “SUPER NICE,” listing coffee, pastries, donuts, and sandwiches. A person stands at the walk-up ordering window on a raised platform with a railing and iron stairs leading up to it, while another person waits on the sidewalk to the left. There is a wooden bench on street level with another window above it. The storefront features a pig logo, menu boards, a sandwich-board sign, and is set between red brick buildings with leafy branches overhead.](assets/cafes/nice.jpg)
_They hand you the order out of the window on the right which is, frankly, completely wild[^c7]_

If you ever go to Super Nice, it is absolutely imperative that you type in your phone number while you’re paying. I know that may seem weird, but their marketing texts are some of the most unhinged messages I’ve ever received, and they make me smile every time. Their pastries and donuts are delicious, and they have a really good selection of each. My favorite detail is that they have colored tiles on the menu for each flavor of donut, it makes it a little more fun to order. The coffee is also lovely, and I appreciate any cafe that’s only an ordering window (even if the stairs make things awkward). It’s also a cafe I really like in an area that, IMO, has a surprising lack of good espresso unless you have access to Columbia buildings. My favorite memory is working on assignments, getting a text from them advertising two-for-one donuts, and walking over in the pouring rain listening to TV Girl to obtain my cheap donuts.

[^c1]: I then drove 2 hours to my change of name court hearing, it was a big day.
[^c2]: I also found out they hosted “coffee with a cop” while looking for images which is uhhhhh, a little more concerning.
